          <div class="content"><h3>Using Node Cloudq Server at Jack Russell Software</h3> <p>Since May of 2011, Jack Russell Software has been using node-cloudq (<a href="https://github.com/twilson63/node-cloudq">https://github.com/twilson63/node-cloudq</a>) server for publishing to and consuming messages from a queue to offload back office tasks and various other jobs.  Cloudq has been through a number of manifestations, but has grown to be an invaluable tool for us.  Issues have been near null and the simplicity of use wonderful.  The documentation on github ( <a href="https://github.com/twilson63/node-cloudq/wiki/">https://github.com/twilson63/node-cloudq/wiki/</a> ) has been recently updated and is pretty good, but really is almost uneccessary due to how simpe the concept is.  </p>  <p>The idea is that messages are stored as json data in a couchdb server.
This could be switched to use mongo (which we did use for some time) or
another datastore like redis.  The queue is just a Broadway (<a href="https://github.com/flatiron/broadway">https://github.com/flatiron/broadway</a>) app to use the couchdb plugin. This can be done with a simple post in any language (curl examples are in the readme for cloudq). </p>  <p>Once a message is posted with a klass name and array of args as json, it
gets set to 'queued' (json format ex. in readme).  Dequeueing the message is just an http GET, which can be done in any language as well.  After the message has been consumed, whatever process you are using to check for new messages can do whatever you would like with the message args.</p>  <p>a quick example of dequeing a message in ruby using the ruby cloudq
client:</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/twilson63/cloudq_client">https://github.com/twilson63/cloudq_client</a></p>  <pre><code><span class="identifier"><span class="keyword">require</span></span> <span class="string">'cloudq'</span>
<span class="identifier">queues</span> = [<span class="string">'do_something'</span>]

  <span class="identifier"><span class="keymethods">sleep</span></span> <span class="number">5</span>
<span class="identifier"><span class="keyword">end</span></span>

  <span class="identifier"><span class="keyword">end</span></span>
<span class="identifier"><span class="keyword">end</span></span>
</code></pre> <p>There is also a node client ( <a href="https://github.com/twilson63/node-cloudq-client">https://github.com/twilson63/node-cloudq-client</a> )
and a few others (even one in C#), but it is very simple to roll your own in any language desired.  </p>  <p>CloudQ has been a very helpful tool to have in our back pocket and 'just
works' almost with out fail.</p>  <p>If you have a chance, it is definitely worth experimenting with.  There
are many tools that can accomplish the same thing, but this is the
simplest, most versatile one I know of.  Thanks yet again, Tom, for making our
lives a little easier with such a simple piece of software.</p>  <p><img src="node-cloudq/cloudq.png" alt="CloudQ" title="CloudQ"></p> </div>

As with all software, this is still a work in progress, but seems to work beautifully for getting started with an express app.  I managed to put up a working demo of a chess game I was working on using this generator in a little under an hour.  </p>  <p>demo:  <a href="http://cupcake-demo.jit.su/">http://cupcake-demo.jit.su/</a></p>  <p>github src:  <a href="https://github.com/gradus/cupcake-demo">https://github.com/gradus/cupcake-demo</a></p>  <p>To get started:</p>  <p>npm install cupcake -g</p>  <p>cupcake [your project name]</p>  <p>(you will be prompted for the templating engine and database type) </p>  <p>cd [your project name]</p>  <p>npm install .</p>  <p>node app.js</p>  <p>visit localhost:3000</p>  <p>If you open the project with your favorite text editor (hopefully, Vim),
you will see that the project is all set up as a skeleton for you.  The
addition of connect-assets was just recently added and you are now able
to use Stylus and Nib.  This makes it super simple to get started with an express app.  Happy hacking!  Thanks Tom.</p>  <p><img src="cupcake-nodejs-project-generator/cupcake.jpeg" alt="Cupcake" title="Cupcake"></p> </div>

 <p>"I had a blast at NodeSummit.  I am real excited about NodeJS.  It was crazy all the things that are going on.  In my mind it is a full shift into what I believe will be the future of software!</p>  <ul><li>Applications composed of small components</li><li>Applications that can run on 1000 cpu machines</li><li>Presentation focused on the client, server focused on JSON/HTTP interfaces </li></ul> <p>  Javascript Everywhere!</p>  <p>  I think any developer will be a fool to overlook this technology.  IMO it is a huge technology shift and will be the norm in 2 years.  Async programming style is the reality and sync is close to dead.  I think/hope other languages will re-invent themselves, but it is not so much a language issue as much as a paradigm shift and the fact that processors can't double anymore.  Threaded programming is not the answer, it is too hard for a few and a mirage for the masses.  As it approaches load, the resources and time consumed trying to troubleshoot race conditions and other threaded stuff under the hood is beyond the creators of most apps.  Learning to break your application into solid loosely coupled pieces is the right thing to do at point of design!  Most current languages are not focused on making async programming enjoyable, they are focused on hiding the fact you are doing async programming and that is just as bad as StupidSense on an IDE."</p>  <p><img src="tom-wilson-on-nodejs/jackdog.png" alt="Jack Russell Software" title="Jack Russell Software"></p></div>

things I have ever worked with. I really like how all I have to type is
<em>jitsu deploy</em> inside the app directory.  jitsu CLI does everything for you from creating the app, figuring out the subdomain and deploying the app to nodejitsu. It even creates the package.json files for you with all dependencies and versioning.  Node 0.6.9 apps will run fine on nodejitsu.</p>  <p>I am still trying to wrap my head
around flatiron ( <a href="http://flatironjs.org/">http://flatironjs.org/</a> ), but have found that the tools that nodejitsu is offering work very well in general and hope to have the time to continue playing around with everything they have to offer. Their documentation is incredible.  I do wish that I could see some more real world examples of how to work with flatiron, union and director, but given the time I should be able to
figure it out without too much hand holding.  I hope nodejitsu is very successful and this business model continues to flourish and be an option for me to use in the future for deployment of node apps.  Thanks a lot for all of the fantastic work you have done.  Hopefully Nodejitsu will continue to focus only on NodeJS and Javascript and not take the direction of Heroku since the Saleforce takeover.  Heroku is now trying to support way too many languages. I like the idea of doing one thing and doing it well.  This invite has really gotten me stoked on working with NodeJs again after quite a number of weeks of not writing any code at all.
Perfect timing guys.  </p>  <p><img src="playing-with-nodejitsu/nodejitsu.png" alt="Nodejitsu" title="Nodejitsu"></p> </div>
