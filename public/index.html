          <div class="content"><p>I recently received my beta invite to nodejitsu PaaS.</p>  <p><a href="http://nodejitsu.com/">http://nodejitsu.com/</a></p>  <p>I have to say that as far as a beta goes, this is one of the smoothest
things I have ever worked with. I really like how all I have to type is
<em>jitsu deploy</em> inside the app directory.  jitsu CLI does everything for you from creating the app, figuring out the subdomain and deploying the app to nodejitsu. It even creates the package.json files for you with all dependencies and versioning.  Node 0.6.9 apps will run fine on nodejitsu.</p>  <p>I am still trying to wrap my head
around flatiron ( <a href="http://flatironjs.org/">http://flatironjs.org/</a> ), but have found that the tools that nodejitsu is offering work very well in general and hope to have the time to continue playing around with everything they have to offer. Their documentation is incredible.  I do wish that I could see some more real world examples of how to work with flatiron, union and director, but given the time I should be able to
figure it out without too much hand holding.  I hope nodejitsu is very successful and this business model continues to flourish and be an option for me to use in the future for deployment of node apps.  Thanks a lot for all of the fantastic work you have done.  Hopefully Nodejitsu will continue to focus only on NodeJS and Javascript and not take the direction of Heroku since the Saleforce takeover.  Heroku is now trying to support way too many languages. I like the idea of doing one thing and doing it well.  This invite has really gotten me stoked on working with NodeJs again after quite a number of weeks of not writing any code at all.
Perfect timing guys.  </p>  <p><img src="playing-with-nodejitsu/nodejitsu.png" alt="Nodejitsu" title="Nodejitsu"></p> </div>
