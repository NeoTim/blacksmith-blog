            <div class="content"><h3>Open source Contributions</h3>
<p>Recently, I have really made a push to start contributing as much of my
spare time as possible to open source.  I have to first start out by saying I feel github is the most wonderful tool created for making this possible.

</p>
<p>In the past month I have made contributions to:

</p>
<h5>NodeJS projects.</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nodester.com">Nodester</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isaacs/npm">NPM</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu">Jitsu</a></li>
</ul>
<h5>Ruby Gems</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rquery-activerecord">rquery-activerecord</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have written several examples of how to integrate various node tools
into frameworks and cloned what appears to be an abondoned project tht I love called <a href="https://github.com/gradus/coffeecup">CoffeeCup</a>. It is a way to write you templates in <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>.  This has spawned some wonderful new ideas from Tom Wilson.

</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/twilson63/creamer">Creamer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/twilson63/coffeecup-helpers">CoffeeCup Helpers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently we are working on some <a href="https://github.com/mikeal/tako">Tako</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/flatiron">Flatiron</a> examples to
integrate into CoffeeCup.  I am very excited about the roadmap we are
planning for <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> templating and all
of the hard work Tom has put into making this happen.

</p>
<p>In addition, I have created my first npm module and a few various other
projects that you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/gradus">github profile
page</a>


</p>
<h3>Get Started Contributing</h3>
<h5>Contributing to open source is simple</h5>
<p>Just follow a couple of steps and you will be experiencing the
gratification that I have felt from trying to better the tools that I
use for myself and others that use them.

</p>
<ol>
<li>You must have a <a href="https://github.com">github</a> account.  I am assuming that
the readers of this article understand github and how the following
processes work.</li>
<li>Find a project that you like, use regularly or are interested in learning.</li>
<li>Fork the project if you have intentions of contributing to the
source code.</li>
<li>At the very least, study the code and see if you can find something
that might be a nice addition or bug fix and submit an issue.</li>
<li>Start by helping improve documentation or fixing minor bugs.<br>This will help you get to know the code better.</li>
<li>Usually, there will be some issues in a project that are
simple and it is just a matter of tracking down the code and adding a
few lines or removing to fix.</li>
</ol>
<h5>There are a few advantages to contributing to open source</h5>
<ol>
<li>You have the control to help make better the tools you use.</li>
<li>You have the ability to make these tools better for others to use.</li>
<li>You take the time to read other people's code which, in a lot of cases can make you a better programmer.</li>
<li>You are learning and expanding your knowledge outside of your
everyday work routine.</li>
<li>You will get a feeling of satisfaction that can only be explained by
actually being a contributor as opposed to a user of software.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to github for making it so easy to find, track and contribute to open source software. Thank you, also, to <a href="http://coderwall.com">Coderwall</a> for making a fun game out of contributing by giving developers and teams badges and awards that encourage open source software.  My team, <a href="http://jackhq.com">Jack Russell Software</a> has managed to stay in the top thirty contributors for some time due to our many individual contributions to open source software in our spare time. Visit the <a href="http://coderwall.com/leaderboard">Coderwall Leaderboard</a> to see the top open source contributors. You can also visit our <a href="http://coderwall.com/teams/4f27194a973bf00004000565">Jack Russell Team Page</a> or my <a href="http://coderwall.com/gradus">personal Coderwall profile page</a>

</p>
<p>I do want to take time to thank teams like <a href="http://nodejitsu.com/">Nodejitsu</a> and <a href="http://nodester.com">Nodester</a> for providing many open source tools to develop and deploy one of my new favorite technologies and what I feel could be a major player in the next few years, <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodeJS</a>.

</p>
<p>Open source is, in my opinion, the best way to develop good software.  The idea of having as many eyes as possible on the codebase and making suggestions and fixes is moste definitely preferable to a select team of programmers managing everything.
