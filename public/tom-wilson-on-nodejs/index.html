<p>"I had a blast at NodeSummit.  I am real excited about NodeJS.  It was crazy all the things that are going on.  In my mind it is a full shift into what I believe will be the future of software!


</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications composed of small components</li>
<li>Applications that can run on 1000 cpu machines</li>
<li>Presentation focused on the client, server focused on JSON/HTTP interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>  Javascript Everywhere!

<p>  I think any developer will be a fool to overlook this technology.  IMO it is a huge technology shift and will be the norm in 2 years.  Async programming style is the reality and sync is close to dead.  I think/hope other languages will re-invent themselves, but it is not so much a language issue as much as a paradigm shift and the fact that processors can't double anymore.  Threaded programming is not the answer, it is too hard for a few and a mirage for the masses.  As it approaches load, the resources and time consumed trying to troubleshoot race conditions and other threaded stuff under the hood is beyond the creators of most apps.  Learning to break your application into solid loosely coupled pieces is the right thing to do at point of design!  Most current languages are not focused on making async programming enjoyable, they are focused on hiding the fact you are doing async programming and that is just as bad as StupidSense on an IDE."
