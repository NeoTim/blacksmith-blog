            <div class="content"><p>I recently received my beta invite to nodejitsu PaaS.</p>  <p><a href="http://nodejitsu.com/">http://nodejitsu.com/</a></p>  <p>I have to say that as far as a beta goes, this is one of the smoothest
things I have ever worked with. I really like how all I have to type is
<em>jitsu deploy</em> inside and app directory.  jitsu CLI does everything for you from creating the app, figuring out the subdomain and deploying the app to nodejitsu. It even creates the package.json files for you with all dependencies and versioning.  Node 0.6.9 apps will run fine on nodejitsu.</p>  <p>I am still trying to wrap my head
around flatiron ( <a href="http://flatironjs.org/">http://flatironjs.org/</a> ), but have found that the tools that nodejitsu is offering work very well. The documentation is incredible.  I do wish
that I could see some more real world examples of how to work with
flatiron, union and director, but given the time I should be able to
figure it out.  I hope nodejitsu is very successful and this service
continues to be an option for me.  Thanks a lot guys for all of the
fantastic work.  This has really gotten me stoked on working with NodeJs
again after quite a number of weeks of not writing any code at all.
Perfect timing on the invite.  </p>  <p><img src="playing-with-nodejitsu/nodejitsu.png" alt="Nodejitsu" title="Nodejitsu"></p> </div>
