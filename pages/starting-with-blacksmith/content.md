Getting started with Blacksmith.  http://blacksmith.jit.su/all-pages


Just getting started with nodejitsu and really like the idea of this
static site generator for a blog.  I was unable to get it to run without
explicitly stating http-server v0.2.x in my package.json.  v0.3 does not seem to work with Blacksmith.
