##### List of some new node projects I have been involved with or experimenting with.

Just wanted to list a few nodeJS repos that I have been playing with. Diving into new technologies and offering some contributions. Basically, just experimentations I have been doing over the past few weeks.  Want to give a big thanks to Tom Wilson for teaching me the mediator pattern and offering the Linchpin npm module and basically putting up with my craziness while pairing with me.  


I am basing my very rough work in progress surf scoring application on this event driven coffeescript pattern. 

And of course I have to give a big shout out to the guys at Nodejitsu for allowing me to use their beta Paas to host some of these rough experiments and for their tools that are just freaking amazing.

The last one on the list is actually a basic Rails spree shopping cart I
have set up online to sell my => NaN (Not a Ninja) gear
(http://not-a-ninja.herokuapp.com).  As you can tell I am clearly 'Not a
Ninja'.  Jeff Squires of Rails Dog motivated me to get this up and running with a
wonderful presentation on Spree at the Charleston Ruby Users group

I have recently taken over my own version of CoffeeKup, called CoffeeCup.

https://github.com/gradus/coffeecup 

I will be actively maintaining it and contributions are more than welcome.  It is a wonderful way to write templates in coffeescript.
