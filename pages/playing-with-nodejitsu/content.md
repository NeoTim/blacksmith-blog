I recently received my beta invite to nodejitsu PaaS.

http://nodejitsu.com/

I have to say that as far as a beta goes, this is one of the smoothest
things I have ever worked with.  I am still trying to wrap my head
around flatiron ( http://flatironjs.org/ ), but have found that the tools that nodejitsu is
offering work very well. The documentation is incredible.  I do wish
that I could see some more real world examples of how to work with
flatiron, union and director, but given the time I should be able to
figure it out.  I hope nodejitsu is very successful and this service
continues to be an option for me.  Thanks a lot guys for all of the
fantastic work.  This has really gotten me stoked on working with NodeJs
again after quite a number of weeks of not writing any code at all.
Perfect timing on the invite.
